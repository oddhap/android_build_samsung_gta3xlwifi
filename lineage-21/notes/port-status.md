# SM-T510 LineageOS 21 development port

Status: source preparation and platform adaptation; no flashable build verified yet.

The Android platform is the current LineageOS lineage-21.0 branch, downloaded
independently from the working LineageOS 19.1 checkout. Android userspace remains
ARM32 because the Samsung graphics libraries are ARM32; the kernel remains ARM64.
No GApps, GSI or partition layout changes are planned.

Initial adaptations:
- Separate device configuration under lineage-21/device/samsung/gta3xlwifi.
- Native bounded CPU/GPU boost uses the Android 14 AIDL NDK power enums and
  upstream android.hardware.power-ndk_shared defaults.
- Samsung's bootloader adds skip_initramfs and a physical system root. Android 14
  removed the obsolete BOARD_BUILD_SYSTEM_ROOT_IMAGE variable but unconditionally
  combines root and system when producing system.img. The original SAR boot
  path is therefore retained; a proposed ramdisk opt-in is unnecessary and is
  not included in this port.
- Kernel 4.4 has no enabled eBPF syscall/cgroup networking support. Common legacy
  Connectivity patches silently ignore firewall operations; these are not a
  sufficient replacement for actual filtering. A real legacy backend or kernel
  backport is required before a functional/safe networking claim.
- Encryption, VINTF, stock vendor SELinux compatibility and physical image sizes
  require Android 14 validation. Existing Android 12 test reports do not validate
  Android 14.

Reference checkouts on build VM:
- /srv/android/src/lineage-21.0 (platform source sync)
- /srv/android/source-audit/lineage21/connectivity-legacy
- /srv/android/source-audit/lineage21/netd-upstream
- /srv/android/source-audit/lineage21/netd-ul
- /srv/android/source-audit/lineage21/build-ul
- /srv/android/source-audit/lineage21/kernel-qcom-4.4

Only selected, reviewed compatibility changes should be carried into fresh
upstream projects; an old fork must not replace current security patches wholesale.

Current progress (2026-10-02):
- Source sync completed; exact manifest saved under
  /srv/android/artifacts/lineage-21/lineage-21.0-source-manifest.xml.
- Targeted builds pass the complete Tethering APEX, netd, networking JNI and
  statistics, PowerManager JNI, API/ABI checks and generated SELinux tests.
- Native networking uses actual iptables/qtaguid filtering and counters. It
  covers all nine child chains, the global firewall, data saver, UID/iface rules,
  VPN lockdown, ingress discard, socket tags and DNS blocking.
- DNS/socket callbacks are registered explicitly across the APEX boundary.
  The final APEX contains both private callback exports and the DNS dependency.
  Private integration symbols do not alter the public SDK headers.
- The compiled OEM Binder descriptor remains com.android.internal.net.IOemNetd;
  JarJar exclusions match both the service and its unsolicited-event listener.
- Host policy/rollback and parser/error tests pass. Physical packet tests on the
  running Android 12 kernel install IPv4/IPv6 rules and verify real IPv4 allow/
  deny behavior. IPv6 packets and Android 14 Binder operation are not yet tested.
  Every private test chain/hook was removed; SELinux remains enforcing and ADB
  was restored to unrooted operation.
- A device-only m4 guard avoids duplicate ISO9660/UDF genfs labels while retaining
  the actual Samsung vendor labels. Stock vendor CIL links with Android init's
  normal runtime flags. The diagnostic strict cross-version link fails with
  legacy Samsung neverallow conflicts; the Android 12 baseline also fails this
  strict check. This limitation remains documented rather than changing vendor
  rules or disabling generated platform policy checks.
- All six platform patches apply against clean pinned source indexes. The full
  bacon build is running with the original verified kernel/vendor/DTBO.
- Full ROM completion, image/VINTF/encryption checks, hardware boot and stability
  testing are pending. No LineageOS 21 image has been flashed.
