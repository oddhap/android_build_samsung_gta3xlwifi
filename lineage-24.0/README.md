# LineageOS 24.0 device port — Samsung SM-T510

Active development target: LineageOS 24.0 / Android 17, ARM64 with ARM32 apps,
`gta3xlwifi`, physical non-A/B partitions. This is an unfinished source-built
device port. No installation candidate is approved.

The official manifest was inspected at
`b51a0c449a3279ca55fb6d4d91d2143e42e2fff5` (`android-17.0.0_r1`).
The official `aosp_current` release alias resolves to `cp2a` in the inspected
build/release revision `c85f4aebe46714235599a9bd6430a0fe30c6e8d5`.
Use the alias in a fresh build shell rather than the old `bp4a` target.

The active 23.2 snapshot's 13 patches were rebased to 14 project changes:
`fs_mgr` now lives in `system/fs/fs_mgr`, libmeminfo includes changed, cgroup v2
app/system isolation is unconditional, and task-profile load ordering changed.
Device changes are committed separately on `lineage-24.0-arm64`; the remaining
13 patches are revision/hash locked in `snapshots/port-20261101-02/source-lock.json`.
Snapshot 01 records the initial partial-file preflight. Active snapshot 02 now
has a complete source audit: 1,243 locked projects, 13 exact platform patches,
no external alternates. Product configuration passes for Android 17, LineageOS
24.0, ARM64/ARM32 and build ID CP2A.260605.016. This is not a full ROM build.

The cgroup port retains cpuacct v1 process groups, mounts real supported v1
controllers, skips v2 subtrees only for this product, loads product profiles last,
and returns `EOPNOTSUPP` for the new clone-into-v2 API. Its Android 17 zygote
callers and runtime behavior require further investigation. Host cleanup/path
checks are separate from Android execution. Optional GPU BPF accounting still
reports unavailable, rather than invented counters. Existing safety/installer
and strict SELinux checks remain enforced.

## Workspace and server

Local workspace: `/Users/oddi/Documents/Samsung-Lineage24`.
Main Git checkout: `integration/`; device checkout: `device/`.
The local `archive/` retains prior handoff, selected source/work files and a
compressed copy of server port inputs; private keys are not copied or published.
SSH uses the existing key in the old workspace, through SSH only.

Server paths use `lineage-24.0-arm64` under `/srv/android/{src,ports,artifacts,logs}`.
Compiler cache: `/srv/android/ccache-lineage-24.0`.
The explicitly requested migration deletes the five old 23.2 directories only,
after checking the 13 active patch hashes and absence of protected-tree object
alternates into 23.2. LineageOS 21, its Git reference cache, TWRP, original kernel,
firmware, signing material and device data remain protected.

Setup pins the manifest HEAD, all modified platform project revisions,
device/kernel/vendor baselines and real VNDK30. It syncs independent objects,
records a full locked manifest, audits clean sources, stages hash-bound binary
inputs, applies the port and audits the full patched tree. It then runs inherited
host regressions and product configuration. Logs and exit files distinguish all
stages. A clean-source sync marker alone is not a successful port validation.
No ROM is signed, installed or flashed by setup.

## Remaining compatibility gates

The inherited [isolated experiments](experiments/) remain work in progress.
The final networking/kernel graph also has a new Android 17 isolated rebase;
old Android 16 diagnostics and counts are historical. Regenerate policy,
networking and runtime evidence against Android 17. No experiment Image is
promoted into the device prebuilts. Keep the combined FunctionFS/NNP patch graph.

Strict actual-vendor SELinux, whole-kernel policycap semantics, legacy networking,
zygote/cgroups, Bionic/ART/Binder, HAL/APEX/both ABIs, graphics, Samsung TEE/FBE,
recovery/OTA and physical partition sizing remain gates. Existing Android 14
GApps and recovery encryption results are not Android 17 validation. No neverallow
or enforcement bypass is authorized. Hardware installation requires a concrete
candidate, verified private backup/rollback plan and separate owner approval.

## November 1: selected MTP vendor input

The owner explicitly selected the updated LineageOS 21 vendor image containing
the FunctionFS MTP USB init fix. Sparse SHA-256:
`a847a527931d61e5702b8a025210c84eb88a37ef1e60df93b6393a16dae9183a`.
The device OTA input guard and setup now pin that same digest; the Android 14
installer restriction remains. The observed initial failure was an input hash
mismatch after successful sync and clean audit of all 1,243 projects. The failed
exit files are archived in the server logs before recovery. Only the reviewed
device commit is updated, followed by a fresh full clean audit, input staging
and the normal patched-tree validation. Android 14 MTP transfer evidence is
recorded separately and does not certify Android 17 USB functionality.

The active snapshot is now `port-20261101-02`: full Git object IDs make exact
diff hashing independent of repository size and `core.abbrev`. All 13 patch
hunks are unchanged from snapshot 01. Eight replay-safety tests pass, including
changed abbreviation settings; checksum, revision, untracked-file, local-edit
and path/duplicate rejection checks remain. Historical snapshot 01 is retained.

## First Android 17 native compilation

`tools/build-bringup.sh NEW_LABEL [MODULE ...]` performs a full source audit and
checks all three binary input digests before starting the named module build.
It holds build.lock, refuses reused labels and audits again on successful exit.
The default target set covers Samsung Audio HIDL 4.0, real VNDK30, cgroups,
filesystem/memory/GPU support, Bionic/linker/linkerconfig and platform policy.
It does not package or sign a ROM or contact the tablet. The first attempt is
`native-policy-20261101-01`; inspect its log/exit and report before further work.
Do not modify sources until the build has stopped. Platform-policy compilation
alone does not establish strict compatibility with actual Samsung vendor policy.
